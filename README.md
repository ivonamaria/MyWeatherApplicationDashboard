# Weather Dashboard

This project requires the utilization of an API to display weather forecasts for various cities, enabling users to plan their trips accordingly. To retrieve weather information for cities, the 5 Day Weather Forecast API was implemented. The API registration process is necessary to obtain an API key for accessing this service.
